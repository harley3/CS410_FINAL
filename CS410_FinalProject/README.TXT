### Software Implementation ###
The provided software uses an Eclipse project which encompasses 2 java files: QueryManager.java and QueryRankerUI.java.
Together these two files load the Lucene Java Library, read in a command-line query term string, and returns documents 
relevant to the search query. These documents are displayed via the console as a comma separated list which is later 
parsed by the enclosed PHP file. This PHP file resides on a web server with access to running external files such as the provided QueryManager.jar.

An example of this PHP implementation with the QueryManager.jar can be found at: 
https://iamhumanoid.com/conradharley/CS410/

Furthermore, the viewDoc.php file simply creates HTML links to the relevant documents in the ./input folder by utilizing the comma separated list generated by the QueryManager.java which also indexes this same ./input folder.
